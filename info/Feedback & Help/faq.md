# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are the questions about omg.lol that we hear most often.

## I changed my mind and I’d like a different address. Can you change it?

Unfortunately we can’t change addresses once they’ve been issued. You can have multiple addresses on your account, though, so you can always add another address whenever you’d like.

## Is there a free tier available?

No, this service sustains itself with money. We would never resort to the kinds of gross things that other services with free tiers do (advertising, selling customer data, etc.). We do things the old fashioned way—we collect money in exchange for a service.

## I used to have an account, but I kinda forgot about it, and now I can’t log in. Help?

If you didn’t renew your address before it expired, and you didn’t have any other active addresses associated with your account, then your account would have been removed at the time of your address’s expiration. If you register a new address, you’ll get a new account along with it.

## I just want to buy one or two of the services, not all of them. Can I do this?

No, all of our services are bundled together and come under the one annual price. Because all services are tied to the "address", if you were to just use one or two services, the other ones would still be locked under that address.
