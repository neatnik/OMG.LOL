# About omg.lol

It all started with a cool domain name. [Adam](https://adam.omg.lol) registered omg.lol (the domain) in 2019, originally for personal use but quickly saw that it would be a cruel waste of awesomeness to squander it. A little creativity and programming later, omg.lol (the service) was born, letting anyone join in on the fun.

## The team

omg.lol is made by our [team](https://staff.lol), and this service is their passion. But all of our members are part of our broader community as well, and your ideas and feedback make the service what it is.

## The tech

omg.lol is unabashedly built with [PHP](https://www.php.net) on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) and [Linode](https://linode.com) hardware running the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/intro/about) operating system. Mail is lovingly processed with [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org), and everything else is highly customized magic. <i class="fas fa-sparkles"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-sparkles"></i>

## The art

Penelope, our totally rad pigeon mascot, was illustrated by the incredibly talented [Bree Lundberg](https://breelundberg.com). Prami, our heart logo, was illustrated by the equally astounding [Momo](https://www.heyheymomo.com).

The icons you see throughout the site are by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com).
