# Discord

We're big fans of our [social.lol IRC server](https://home.omg.lol/info/irc), but we know IRC is not for everybody. We've created this Discord server to act as a Bridge between IRC and Discord, so we can get the best of both worlds. 

### Joining

Visit the social.lol page inside your dashboard and connect your Discord account. This process will join you to the server, verify your account, and set your nickname to match your omg.lol address. This process is necessary to ensure proper linking between IRC and Discord, and ensures that everybody's presence matches their address.
